# Calculator
I embarked on this calculator project for The Odin Project with the goal of crafting my own solution. After exploring different approaches, I found valuable insights in an article by Zell Liew on Medium, which served as a helpful guide.

Building on that foundation, I implemented several additional features to enhance the calculator's functionality and user experience:

- Keyboard Support
- Overflow Handling
- Approaching Zero Behaviour
- Decimal Precision
- Visual Effects

Thank you for taking your time reading this. Have a good day :)
